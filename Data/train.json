Many prominent intellectuals believe Aavarana dangerously advanced the fundamentalist agenda by tilting at the windmills of history, and that it seeks to divide society on communal lines. On the other hand, the writer's original posit that the Truth needs to be told has connected with the readers that it has seen repeated reprintings. The author has vigorously protested the tag that the book is inflammatory by challenging the reviewers to refute the points made in the book. It is also pertinent to note that the author anticipated the criticism that the book would receive and has worked in the book, the reasons why books and criticisms should not be banned or suppressed.",

The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI) took over control of the station in 1855 and an lifeboat house was built three years later. The station covered the shipping lane in and out of Liverpool. In 1890 Holyhead Lifeboat Station received its first steam lifeboat, which was one of six to serve in the RNLI. The lifeboat was involved in an operation to rescue crewmembers of the SS Harold in 1908 which anchored near rocks between [[North Stack|North Stack]] and [[South Stack|South Stack]]. It was retired in 1928 when it was replaced by a motor-powered lifeboat and twenty-one years later a new boathouse and slipway were constructed on [[Salt Island|Salt Island, Anglesey]]. The boathouse and slipway were used until 1980 when a new Arun class boat was allocated to the station and kept afloat in the harbour. Unfortunately, wash from the ferry traffic lead to the boat's GRP hull being damaged and as a temporary measure a steel hulled Waveney class boat was placed on station while the boathouse and slipway were reconditioned and a new Tyne class boat was constructed for the station. The new boat entered service in 1985 and slipway launching continued until 1997 when a new, more protected, berth was found for an Arun class boat to take over, to be replaced in 2003 by the present Severn class.An inshore lifeboat station was established on the site in 1967.

He has even paid for a coffin, taking advantage of a funeral home's Summer Sale. Nowadays the only companion Rene has is Bwakaw, a stray dog that hangs around his house and follows him wherever he goes. As Rene waits for the day of his death, he gets the surprise of his life when it is Bwakaw who suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer. Rene is surprisingly affected, and he realizes that he values Bwakaw more than he thinks. In his struggle to get Bwakaw cured, Rene finds comfort in the most unlikely person: Sol, a tricycle driver who helps him bring Bwakaw to the vet and befriends him. Buoyed by Sol's friendship, Rene starts living. Little by little he discovers simple joys. To the surprise of his friends, he even has his hair dyed to look younger. One day, he finally decides to make a move on Sol. The revelation that Rene is gay and has feelings for him surprises and disgusts Sol. He rejects Rene and leaves in anger. In the meantime, Bwakaw's condition gets worse. Not even Rene's ancient Santo Entierro (a supposedly miraculous statue of Jesus Christ) can save Bwakaw. Bwakaw dies, and Rene's neighbors help him bury the faithful dog. But Bwakaw's death, even while it was still only imminent, has made a difference.
